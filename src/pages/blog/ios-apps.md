If your app in this list — it's time to celebrate it!

## Best apps

![Good apps](/img/ios-ui-apps.png)

In iOS 11 Apple finally realesed new UI. Previously they tested it in Apple Music app. I am talking about this new design of standard apps with big (very big headers). There's a lot of people who hate this design, but I really love it. This is because iOS using very good font — San Francisco.

After two years a lot of developers redisigned their apps to math new design guidlines, but a lot of devs created an UI, that similar to iOS, but not the same. Wrong fonts, wrong text size and wrong animation... That's because I wrote this article about good apps to say their developers "Thanks!"

## Memento

Very good example. This is a reminder app that connects to default iOS awful Reminders app. Different themes, some little customization and little more. This is a paid app, but worth it.

## Procreate

Procreate is an app for creaters (wow). They have also a pocket version for iPhone, but both pocket and full versison match iOS UI Kit. I haven't bought any of version, but I saw screenshots and good reviews from users (just follow [Procreate](https://twitter.com/Procreate) in twitter).

## PDF Viewer

Very good app from PSPDFKit team. Using it almost every day when I have school lessons, because I refused to use "classic" books and downloaded them in PDF format. I've found this app from [Federico Viticci](https://twitter.com/viticci) twitter account. They have a lot of functionality (probably more, than in a lot of desktop PDF viewers) and customization (dark theme included!). Fast and handy app. Also with tabs support in free version.

## Whatsapp

I hate WhatsApp (sorry Zuckerberg), because we have Telegram, but they support iOS UI Kit and I can't fail to mention they in this list.

There is a lot of other apps like Scriptable (fix search bar, please), Jayson, Pretext and apps, that I didn't use, like Timery and MindNode.

If you can recommend some, please write to me in [Telegram](https://t.me/dtroode) or mention me in [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dtroode).
