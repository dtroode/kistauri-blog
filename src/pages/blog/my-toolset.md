## Who am I?

Firstly who am I. I am starting at web development: HTML, CSS, JS, playing with React.

<h2 name="hardware">Hardware setup</h2>
I am using a Dell Inspiron 13 with 256 GB SSD, 8 GB RAM, and Intel Core i5. Yes, I am not that cool user of Mac, which coming home, opening the laptop with just one finger and using exclusive paid software and after tweet beautiful screenshots of programs.

<h2 name="software">Software setup</h2>

I am using two systems — Windows 10 and Ubuntu (always latest versions). Windows is taking 200 GB, other space is for Ubuntu. Why? Because I love Unix, but Linux is not so independent system, as I want.

Now is time for most interesting. Do you still remember who am I? Frontend developer. Let's look at the main root of building a website/web app:

* Firstly I need to design. For these purposes, I use two programs: Affinity Photo and Figma (mostly second). I don't like Adobe's software.
* Next is writing that drow. Here I don't need an IDE. I have Visual Studio Code — beautiful and powerful replacing of IDE. This is like something between the code editor and IDE. There is one minus — Electron. But VS Code is for projects. If I want to write a few strings of code, I am opening a little brother of Visual Studio Code — Sublime Text. Sublime is the fastest code editor and looks nice.
* Often I need to plan my work. Here we go with Notion and Google Keep. Notion mostly for texts and boards; Keep for task list.
* Other tools:
  		- Terminal — VS Code's built in.
  		- Browsers — Chrome and Firefox.

That's all. Hope, you've found something interesting!
