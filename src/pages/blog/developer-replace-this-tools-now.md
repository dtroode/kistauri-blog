Still use this? Replace now. List of things, that I replaced after a yearn and half of working as front-end developer.

Working tools, that I replaced list:

- **Atom → Sublime Text → VS Code.** I started to code on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) (it's first in [Google](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=learn+to+code)). My first HTML code I copied to Atom and saved on a computer. I have chosen Atom because a long time ago I've searched for a good text editor and see a lot of recommendations. Next, I switched to Sublime Text and loved it. I write a lot of non-release websites and some realized. Next, I heard about the VS Code. It's been very complicated for me but after a few weeks, I completely switched.
- **Beautify → Prettier.** It's very hard to format code by hands, so I need to automize this process. I have used Beautify but recently switched to Prettier with config files.
- **Default monospace font → Fira Code.** The font is a very important thing in the development process. I didn't think much of it before. And once I saw in Twitter some interesting font with a new thing for me — ligatures support. It was Fira Code. Now it's a very popular font.
- **jQuery → clean JS.** I started to code in JS from jQuery tutorial on YouTube. The tutorial said that jQuery is cleaner, smaller, easier and with jQuery you can write a solution for the task in a few strings that take in JS 200 strings. But after some time I've understand that clean JS has more support, cleaner, easier and takes a minimum of space with default support in browsers.
- **CSS → SASS.** Just love this `parent { child }` syntax.
- **Jekyll → Gatsby.** Gatsby is a more progressive static site generator with a lot of default optimizations.
- **Lighthouse → PageSpeed Insights.** So I love green scores in Lighthouse and love it. Recently Google moved Lighthouse to the web with more stability.

If I remember more, I'll extend an article.
