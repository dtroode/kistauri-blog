We live in the era of browser monopoly. So look at another browser!

## Situation

Google occupied the whole web by its Chrome. Chrome has more than 50% of users.

Safari is on the second place just because of macOS popularity.

## Firefox's update

Now, most of the developers choose between Chrome and Firefox. And in 2017 Mozilla released their updated version of Firefox — Firefox Quantum with new customization settings, better extensions support, privacy and what's more important — speed. 2x faster than old Firefox and faster than Chrome.

Firefox using their own new engine with new Quantum CSS and Quantum DOM rendering. A lot of explanations [here](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/11/entering-the-quantum-era-how-firefox-got-fast-again-and-where-its-going-to-get-faster/). And Chrome uses a lot of memory, Firefox — less.

Also, Firefox has a lot of useful features like [showing useless CSS rules](https://twitter.com/nicolaschevobbe/status/1135798960361263104) and supports [prefers-color-scheme: dark](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/05/firefox-67-dark-mode-css-webrender/) media rules, that Chrome supports only in beta now.

Do you scare about extensions? Now, most developers write their extensions for both Chrome and Firefox.

And the final reason — stop the monopoly. Give a chance to other companies that smaller and you can see how frontend develops.
